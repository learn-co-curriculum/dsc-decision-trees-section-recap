# Decision Trees - Recap



## Key Takeaways

The key takeaways from this section include:

* Decision trees can be used for both categorization and regression tasks
* They are a powerful and interpretable technique for many machine learning problems (especially when combined with ensemble methods)
* Decision trees are a form of Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) - you traverse them in a specified direction, and there are no "loops" in the graphs to go backwards
* Algorithms for generating decision trees are designed to maximize the information gain from each split
* A popular algorithm for generating decision trees is ID3 - the Iterative Dichotomiser 3 algorithm
* There are several hyperparameters for decision trees to reduce overfitting - including maximum depth, minimum samples leaf with split, minimum leaf sample size, maximum lead nodes, and maximum features
